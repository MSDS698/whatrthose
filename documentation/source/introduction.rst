Introduction
=============
Have you ever seen a person walking by and thought their shoes were fantastic but didnâ€™t know what they were or how to get them? Why not have a tool where an image can be uploaded and the shoe can be identified and linked to where to buy them.

*What R Those* aims to develop a service for footwear enthusiasts to identify shoes quickly and easily along with how to purchase them. The users are provided with access to an object detection tool that is trained to provide brand, model, and color of the shoe, then a list of where the shoe can be bought at retailers either near the user or the best deals across online retailers.

This documentation provides insight to how the app is laid out, the APIs that can used, and explanation of technical details.
